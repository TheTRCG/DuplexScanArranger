# DuplexScanArranger
Rearranges a document feeder scan to emulate manual duplex

Couldn't find any programs for this so wrote a simple script for this. Curse you big companies who don't bother to add this in their crappy programs

Specifically this is for the HP 4650 Printer, there's a document feeder and once you scan one side of each page you can load the stack again and add it to the same scan and this script will rearrange it.

Future expansions, thinking of making this a program for easily scripting batch PDF edits, interesting exercise in making a full application
